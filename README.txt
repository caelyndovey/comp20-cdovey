Lab 8

1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

This Git repository is a way to keep track of all changes made as we complete
assignments and labs, allowing instructors to view our changes and final
work, while keeping everything private for academic integrity reasons. Additionally, 
it forces us to use git which is a skill that everyone should know who practices 
web development/any kind of software engineering, really.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

I honestly really loved assignment 1 because of the freedom involved in creating
our own website -- I've always wanted to create a personal website but never had 
the tools to do so. I learned a ton from this assignment because I've found that
with this content it's most effective to learn by doing. I had a lot of fun 
stylizing my website and using CSS. However, I will also say that I liked assignment
2 as well because I felt like I had really accomplished something cool!

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

This course is a special one because you can't learn just from lectures, you have to 
actually get your hands dirty and utilize resources, browse stack overflow, etc. It
has helped me learn how to ask for help, what questions to ask, and how to find 
answers on the internet when I need to. Going into this course, I had ZERO experience 
with web development, so I think it is safe to say I grew a lot.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples 
   as evidence.

To be completely honest, I think that the group project / learning how to work with 
a team of people on a project was the most valuable outcome for me. Of course, I've 
had experience partner programming in 40 and 105, but it's much different in a group
of four people where there isn't a detailed spec and not everyone is working on the 
same thing at once. It's more like the real world. I'm headed into my first job as
I graduate in the Spring as a product manager, so I utilized the group project from
that perspective. Before we met each week as a group, for example, I would make a list
of what we needed to get done that day, record who was responsible for what deliverables
in the next week, and other tasks such as "make sure everyone is able to push to the group
github repo". It's hard to stay organized with a project of this scope. 


5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

Even though I have already taken security online, as I am currently working on assignment 4
I'm having a lot of fun with it and would like to continue learning more about security because
it is a topic that is constantly changing and evolving in the real world.

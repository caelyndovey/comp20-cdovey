Lift Knockoff

- All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented, but I will be the first to admit this is some

variable names and functions for long reused chunks of code rather than copy and paste. But alas, 
the deadline approaches. 

- Discussed the assignment in office hours with Ming

- Spent approximately 7 hours on this assignment.
